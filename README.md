# ecommerce-app
An ecommerce website using spring boot + react, deployed through AWS with docker. Made to improve and display my spring boot backend skills.


Nothing costs any money lol, check your accounts payment details after signing up to see a wonderful little treat.


Also, please be aware that while i require info from a user to show most of my functionality, you don't need to
provide any real info about yourself like your real emails and addresses etc. Just make something up for testing purposes.
I considered adding an email confirmation but i do not wish to gatekeep my display of skills by forcing people to reveal
sensitive information into my database. Just make up fake credentials and have fun trying out the website :)


Yes, i made all the item entities manually.
Yes, it made me depressed.
No, i wouldn't do it again.
